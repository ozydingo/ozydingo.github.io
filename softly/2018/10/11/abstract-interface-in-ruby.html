<h2 id="defining-a-code-contract">Defining a code contract</h2>

<p>There are so many reasons I love Ruby more than Java. But there’s one thing Java really gets so right, and it’s the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html">Interface</a>. I like this pattern so much I had to write a pseudo-implementation of this for Ruby.</p>

<p>Using it looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">Duck</span>
  <span class="kp">extend</span> <span class="no">AbstractInterface</span>

  <span class="c1"># args: none</span>
  <span class="c1"># returns: (String message)</span>
  <span class="n">implements</span> <span class="ss">:quack</span>

  <span class="c1"># args: (String, optional) destination</span>
  <span class="n">implements</span> <span class="ss">:fly</span>

  <span class="c1"># args: none</span>
  <span class="c1"># returns: nil</span>
  <span class="n">implements</span> <span class="ss">:eat_bread</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Mallard</span>
  <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="no">Duck</span>

  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quack</span>
    <span class="s2">"I QUACK LIKE A DUCK"</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>

  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">.</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nf">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>By including this module, I am telling clients of my code that I have implemented the <code class="highlighter-rouge">quack</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">fly</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">eat_bread</code> methods, implicitly in the context of being a duck. This is the concept of a “contract”.</p>

<p>In Java, this contract is much more strict. If a class that implements the interface doesn’t define one of the methods, you get a compile-time error. It’s Java, so of course you need to specify the return type and the full list of arguments. Here you can see I’ve left that all out; the contract is on good faith and not strictly enforced, but suggested by the comments. That’s ok, this is Ruby and we don’t need to try to be Java. But we still get the benefits I most desire out of the concept of interfaces while retaining the flexibility Ruby guarantees you of being able to overrule any behavior you want to. As always, with great power comes great responsibly, so use it wisely and don’t be a d*ck.</p>

<p>Enumerated, those benefits are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Developer-friendly documentation. If I was new to a project and wanted to figure out what I need to do to implement my very own duck, I can just look in this interface. Clearly, I need to define these three methods as described. By doing so, my class will do everything any user of the Duck interface expects it to do.</li>
  <li>Identification. I’ve already written about how much <a href="/2016/04/18/duck.html">I hate duck typing</a>. So here you can be much more explicit than <code class="highlighter-rouge">responds_to?(:quack)</code> and actually ask what you mean: <code class="highlighter-rouge">is_a?(Duck)</code>.</li>
  <li>Dev-friendly error messaging. Look for the implementation below. If your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mallard</code> class doesn’t implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">quack</code> and someone tries to call it, you will get a <code class="highlighter-rouge">NoMethodError</code> with the message <code class="highlighter-rouge">Expected class Mallard to implements quack</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>On #3: This is a runtime error, not a compile-time error, because, again, this is Ruby. You’d expect to <code class="highlighter-rouge">include Duck</code> at the top of the class before the method is defined, and to allow that you cannot check if the method was defined on include. If you want to allow the method to be defined dynamically, which would be very ruby-ist of you, you can’t check at app initialization either. And even if you did check and it passed, you could always <a href="https://apidock.com/ruby/Module/undef_method">undefine</a> it later. In my opinion, it’s better to work with your language’s strengths: define the contract as a convention and expectation, but allow the developer to violate it if they really want.</p>

<p><a id="tl-dr" name="tl-dr"></a></p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>It’s pretty minimal:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">module</span> <span class="nn">AbstractInterface</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">implements</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">method_name</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">define_method</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">method_name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">defined?</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">super</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="k">else</span>
        <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="no">NoMethodError</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"Expected </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">class</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> to implement method </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">__method__</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
      <span class="k">end</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
  <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">implements</code> instance method is the head of the duck line here. It takes the method name as an argument and defines a method with that name on the including class. “Wait, it defines the method?” you ask? Well, yes – we’re defining the method to raise our specific <code class="highlighter-rouge">NoMethodError</code> with our desired message. We could instead let it propagate all the way up to the default <code class="highlighter-rouge">NoMethodError</code>, but that would be harder to debug when received, and opens up the possibility that another definition of <code class="highlighter-rouge">method_missing</code> would get in our way. (This concern is also why I chose not to raise the error inside a <code class="highlighter-rouge">method_missing</code> definition, but it’s certainly an option that would avoid the supermethod juggling).</p>

<p>The special <code class="highlighter-rouge">__method__</code> variable is Ruby’s way of cheating and giving us the name of the current method, which lets us throw a more informative error message.</p>

<p>Ah, but if we’re defining a method on the class itself, what if we’re overriding the method defined in a superclass or included module? That why we check <code class="highlighter-rouge">if defined?(super)</code>, and call it if that check returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code>. A performance hit on every call for sure, but a good way to keep in sync with any modules that may be included after this interface.</p>

<p>And that’s it! Not a lot of code. Not a lot of functionality, either. But I’ve found it to be a great tool nonetheless, really helping to define expectations in larger, more complex projects.</p>
