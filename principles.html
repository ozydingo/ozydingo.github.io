      The developer's approach is "how do I write a query or add an API call to get
      that information", while the architect's approach is "how can we make that
      information an obvious and natural consequence of the code design?".
    </p>

      To be clear, you need to blend both framings; the architect's approach is more
      costly up front and that can be not worth it if the product roadmap
      is rapidly pivoting. If, however, we believe we will continue to build on
      these developments with some momentum, the architect's approach pays off
      in the medium to long term. And that's what excites me the most: the ability
      to make an impact on that level, to mold architecture to fit an evolving
      understanding of our use cases such that very few feature requests require
      complex dev-gymnastics but instead are well-supported by a thoughtful and
      robust architecture.
